# Initiation
# This is my testing repository for helping me to learn how to use Github.
# Actually I'm a student who is working as an intern in brokerages in China, and I will upload some of my works in this account.
# Now I'm focusing on the application of reinforcement learning in trading and I'm designing a decision strategy using gradient ascendent.
# If you have any questions or comments about my work, please contact me and let me know your ideas.
